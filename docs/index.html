<h1>Cole Lawrence</h1>
<p>This is a collection of content that I can organize efficiently for reference.</p>
<p>
  The primary goal of this site is to give myself a project to really experiment
  with encapsulating types, protocols, and extremely extensible data viewing and modding support.
</p>
<p>
  The overall goal is to completely overkill the idea of creating a blog just for fun and
  to learn.
